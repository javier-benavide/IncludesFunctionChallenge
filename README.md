# Mini Neat Challenge

Hi! Welcome to the real-time exercise of Neat's mini challenge 04-03-2022

**Please read all this file first**

## Configuration

The first thing is to configure your environment. To do this you need to follow the next steps:

1. Go to [Node JS page](https://nodejs.org/es/), download and install Node JS for your SO
    - To check if node was installed correctly run `node -v` on your terminal to check your Node JS version

2. Install yarn with `npm install --global yarn` 

3. Clone the git repository with `git clone https://github.com/javier-benavide/IncludesFunctionChallenge.git`

4. Go to the cloned directory

5. Install the dependencies with "yarn install"

## Exercise

For the real-time exercise you need to complete the function **includesFunction** inside the file **includesFunction.ts**

Also you need to complete the function **sortFunction** inside the file **sortFunction.ts**

Finally, in each file you will find all the explanation needed for the exercise.

**You can NOT look at any file "*.test.ts" in the entire challenge time**

When you are done with the function you must run `yarn test fileName.spec.ts` and verify that all test are OK for each exercise.
