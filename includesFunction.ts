/*
EXERCISE: Includes Function

Exercise description:

You need to replicate the "string".includes() native function for strings

So arrayIncludes(string, seachedText) === array.includes(value)

But you can not use any .indexOf native function or the .includes
or regex in your code

Also at the end of the arrayIncludes()'s code you need to log how many
loops and recursion depth was used

includes description:

Returns true if searchString appears as a substring of the result of converting
this object to a String, at one or more positions that are greater than or equal
to position; otherwise, returns false.

Testing:

You must know that when you run the testing (yarn test), the first 3 test
shows the input and the expected result. The other test have hidden values
that you will never know until the end of the interview.

/**
 * @param {string}  parentText.
 * @param {string} searchedText.
 * @returns {boolean} True if searchedText is in originalText
 */
export function arrayIncludes(parentText: string, searchedText: string): boolean{
    //Write your code here
    return false;
}
