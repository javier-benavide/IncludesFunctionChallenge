/*
EXERCISE: Sort Function

Exercise description:

You need to replicate the Array.sort() native function for number[]

So sortFunction(initialArray) === initialArray.sort()

You can not use any Math.max or Math.min functions

Also at the end of the sortFunction()'s code you need to log how many
loops and recursion depth was used

Testing:

You must know that when you run the testing (yarn test), the first 3 test
shows the input and the expected result. The other test have hidden values
that you will never know until the end of the challenge.
*/

/**
 * @param {number[]}  initialArray.
 * @returns {number[]} Sorted array from min to max (first index in the min)
 */
export function sortFunction(initialArray: number[]): number[]{
    //Write your code here
    return initialArray;
}
